# Municipal-Complaint-Manager
The java application will take in municipal complaints and would store them in the database, and also manage them.
The app will give categories to store complants and there is login option for the authorities who are managing the 
compliants.
The aithorities can take care of the complaints or update the status. The users can come back and login using their
name and a self generated apssword, which is unique for every user, and see their complaint status.
